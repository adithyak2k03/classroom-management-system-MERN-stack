# Project Build Log

These are the steps I wrote down while progressing through this project.

I wanted to keep a digital record of my thought process while building this app â€” both for future reference and as a reflection of the learning journey.  
(Also, I initially intended to avoid using ChatGPT â€” but I failed that last condition ðŸ˜…)

### 1. Initial Setup
- Created a GitHub repo.
- Started with a simple to-do list app using ReactJS, Node.js, and MongoDB.
- Committed at every major step.
- Goal: No ChatGPT, only online references. (Oops.)

---

### 2. Backend and Frontend Basics
- i. Basic frontend setup.
- ii. Setup database connection.
- iii. Created `Create` and `Read` APIs.

---

### 3. Feature Additions
- i. Added filter by tag.
- ii. Tried a moving background (GIF of books in a library).  
  â†’ Removed it because it didnâ€™t look professional.
- iii. Merged Notes, To-Do List, and Login System projects.

---

### 4. CRUD Fixes
- i. Fixed edit and delete operations for tasks.
- ii. Fixed CRUD operations for notes.

### 5. State Management
- i. Tried using Context API to make logout and dark mode accessible across all pages.

---

### 6. Profile Page
- i. Created a Profile page.
- ii. Chose icons for the app and the profile picture.

---

### 7. Styling Improvements

### 9. Admin Functionality (Initially Planned â€” Now Implemented)

- ii. Admin can manage users (view data, edit, delete, and create users).

---

### 10. Future Work (Not Yet Implemented)
- i. Add profile photo upload feature with file/photo storage.

---

### 11. Homepage
- i. Added a homepage to show the product name.
- ii. Added Login/Signup options and an About section.

---

### 12. Cold Start UX Fix
- i. Added a loading screen on the login page due to delay from backend cold starts.
  
  â†’ Technically not a fix, but a UI enhancement so users donâ€™t think the app is broken while waiting for the API response.
